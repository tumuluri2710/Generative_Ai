The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France.
It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower.
Constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair, it was initially criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but it has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognizable structures in the world.
The tower is 330 metres (1,083 ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-story building. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930.
Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17 ft). Excluding antennae, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.
The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels. The top-level's upper platform is 276 m (906 ft) above the ground â€“ the highest observation deck accessible to the public in the European Union and the second highest in Europe after the Ostankino Tower in Moscow.
